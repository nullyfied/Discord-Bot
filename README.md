# Discord-Bot
Discord bots are one of the most useful features of the communication platform. Discord bots are AIs that can perform a number of useful automated tasks and Discord bot commands on your server, such as welcoming new members, moderating content, banning rule breakers, marketers and business owners can use to perform a wide range of automated tasks on the server. The bot can be deployed to any server will work 24*7. In the existing system the user need to use the web browser for checking latest release notes this make the whole process little slower and time consuming and browser will use the system resources so, we propose a Discord Bot that focuses on giving the information about new release notes of CS:GO automatically directly to the Discord server whenever a game updates. This will allow server members to get fast and reliable information about latest updates. In addition to that we also implemented so many features to our bot such as manger module, level module, tic-tac-toe module etc. Bot will cut down the whole process making it automated and reduce the time and resource consumption.
